# Iterate, match, repeat

> Workshop on Rust iterators, pattern matching and creative coding

The target audience for this workshop are people who have programming experience but are new to Rust.
We will look at some of Rust's more functional features in depth (the title giving ones) and will experiment with them in a creative context.
